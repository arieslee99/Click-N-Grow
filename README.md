## Project Scope

**What will this application do?**
- This application serves as a collaborative opportunity between two users. The premise is simple:
  to grow and maintain plants within a garden. Users will be able to execute functions, such as watering
  plants and adding fertilizer to plants. Such functions are intended to provide a simplistic rendition 
  of real-life gardening. Aside from performing these actions to maintain a garden, the success of this 
  game relies on two users taking turns executing these actions. For example, user A waters and adds
  fertilizer to the garden. In order to perform same actions again, only user B has the ability to do so,
  vice versa. While this may be seen as a limitation, the goal is to encourage users to collaborate on a 
  common goal. 


**Who are the users?**

- This application is targeted towards people who would like to engage in a collaborative game with friends and/or
  loved ones. The goal of the application is to provide an opportunity for collaboration and time for people to 
  develop/cultivate a common interest. Thus, this application is suitable for anyone who wishes to accomplish thereof.
  

**Why does this project of interest to you?**

- This project is of particular interest to me because I have personally experienced the challenges of being away
  from a loved one for an extended period of time. The physical distance had raised struggles of spending quality time
  with one another. Designing this application was, therefore, inspired to provide a potential solution to not just
  myself, but to anyone in a similar context. 

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to select a garden and plant a new seed in it.
- As a user, I want to be able to select a plant in a garden and remove it.
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a plant in a garden as "watered" or "fertilized".
