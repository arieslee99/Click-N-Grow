# Garden Simulation

## Project Scope

**What will this application do?**
- This application is a virtual garden simulation that aims to provide a simplistic rendition of real-life gardening 
  and/or farming. Users are able to start their own garden, and plant seeds. To maintain plants, users can water and 
  fertilize then (according to each plant's specifications). Ripe plants can be harvested, and sold to earn more money
  to purchase more plants for the garden. Aside from performing these actions to maintain a garden, the success of this 
  game relies on two users taking turns executing these actions. For example, user A waters and adds
  fertilizer to the garden. In order to perform same actions again, only user B has the ability to do so,
  vice versa. While this may be seen as a limitation, the goal is to encourage users to collaborate on a 
  common goal. 


**Who are the users?**

- This application is targeted towards people who would like to engage in a collaborative game with friends and/or
  loved ones. The goal of the application is to provide an opportunity for collaboration and time for people to 
  develop/cultivate a common interest. Thus, this application is suitable for anyone who wishes to accomplish thereof.
  

**Why does this project of interest to you?**

- This project is of particular interest to me because I am personally enjoy playing role-playing games (RPGs).
  Inspired by the PC game "Stardew Valley", I am interested to create my own interpretation of it. The collaborative 
  feature of this game is also inspired by my personal preference for collaborative games over single-player games. 
  Designing and implementing this application is, therefore, an attempt to create the "perfect" game for myself.
